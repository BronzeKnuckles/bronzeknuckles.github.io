__I am a Value Investor at heart.__
<br>  
It suits my personality, and I believe in the Margin of Safety.  
It's an economic decision(as it should be).

What I give(price I pay) must be less than what I get in return(value)  
I always buy a share at less than or equal to 50% of its worth.  
That is my margin of safety(standard).

This does 2 things for me :  
 1, If I am wrong, I don't lose much.  
 2, If I am right, I gain a lot.

I understand and believe that no one in the market can be 100% right all the time. Warren Buffett made mistakes, and so did Sir Isaac Newton.

As Graham writes,



 
> Back in the spring of 1720, Sir Isaac Newton owned shares in the South Sea Company, the hottest stock in England. Sensing that the market was getting out of hand, the great physicist muttered that he ‘could calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of the people.’ Newton dumped his South Sea shares, pocketing a 100% profit totaling £7,000. But just months later, swept up in the wild enthusiasm of the market, Newton jumped back in at a much higher price — and lost £20,000 (or more than $3 million in \[2002-2003’s\] money. For the rest of his life, he forbade anyone to speak the words ‘South Sea’ in his presence.





All Investors make mistakes, and sometimes there are unforeseen, unfortunate, unavoidable events.  
But the Intelligent investor knows this. So they play around it, with a margin of safety so that any lousy investment wouldn't wipe their portfolio.  
**Margin of Safety = Margin of error**

In terms of my personality, I have this habit of being overly cautious in investing.

I have had this habit of being overly cautious with money since childhood. When I first began investing, the money I invested was my lunch money and my savings which I gathered by skipping going out, buying things I liked and eating less or not eating at all.

I have made mistakes investing and paid dearly for them, and every small mistake was a painful blow, so I try to be as cautious as possible in my analysis so I don't experience such pain again.

I don't call it being Neurotic, as I can stomach volatility very well. My honest thesis that I have derived from extensive research helps me reinforce my beliefs of a stock's intrinsic value.

When calculating the Intrinsic value, I am cautious by taking realistic scenarios after learning about the business.

---

My philosophy and strategy rest on some foundational first principles.  
My primary assumption is that the market price will reflect a company's intrinsic value in the long term, at least if not in a short time.  
But, I can see a trap in this assumption, how long will I wait before exiting a position? 10 years? 50 years? Never? These are very crucial questions that need to be answered.

My answer is simple, but First, is the intrinsic value growing over time relative to my calculations? Or is it declining ? and how fast is it doing so? The answer to these questions will lead me to the answer to the central question of when to exit. If I see other better opportunities, I will resize accordingly. This is where the artistic nature of portfolio management comes in. Admittedly, it is a little subjective.

Being overly cautious is my strength. However, some might say that it is a weakness. I understand that being overly cautious can lead to missed opportunities.  
Fair enough.  
But I respectfully disagree.  
Because, the difference between missing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and dodging a bullet that might hurt my entire portfolio is insignificant.  
In investing, #1 rule is not to lose money.

Warren Buffett once said,




> _“The first rule of an investment is don't lose (money). And the second rule of an investment is don't forget the first rule. And that's all the rules there are.”_



I understand that investing is not about making money, but protecting it. And how would you do that? By consistently growing it and not losing (or not having too much risk)

Let me use an example,  
I would never ever bet where there is a 75% probability of gaining 50% and a 25% probability of losing 50%.

Because if you lose 50%, you will have to gain 100% to return to square one.

How do I go about this?  
My margin of safety, ruthless analysis, and trying to understand everything I can.  
I even go on to have an 80% margin of safety if I have a hunch that I don't understand as much as I like to, even though I read anything and everything I can handle.

My valuation is simple. The cash the business provides in the future is discounted back into the present. This is the classic DCF(Discounted Cash Flow) method, but I have modified it in terms of rates, cash flow calculations, etc.

Any seasoned investor would know that Free cash flow is not just Operating cashflow - Capital expenditure.

Every business is unique, and the definitions change. Here is where I believe to have another edge:

I can analyze and calculate the _true free cash flow_ with _true operating income_ and _true capex._

This is one-half of it. The other half is how much is the _true price_ to purchase. The sum of my own modified _Enterprise value_ and _opportunity cost._

This is a very simple yet the most effective and time-tested method. The core of investment philosophy in finance and everyday life is sacrificing something today to reap the benefits tomorrow.

Like sowing seeds to harvest later.

Any investment must be made so that what you get in return is worth more than what you give.

That is my core philosophy.

I am self-taught and I guess I am fairly experienced...  
I have beaten the market and am confident I will continue to beat - But I shall never become overconfident.  
I am grateful, and this is me showing my gratitude by sharing knowledge and investing with integrity.
